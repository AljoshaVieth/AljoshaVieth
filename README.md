## Hi, I'm Aljosha 👋🏻 There are many Github profiles in this world, but this one is my very own.
### :man_student: I am currently studying computer science in media at Furtwangen University. For a better overview, I have outsourced all projects that were created during my studies to an organisation. You can find it [here](https://github.com/aljosha-hfu).
