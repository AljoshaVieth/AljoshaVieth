###  Hi, I'm Aljosha üëãüèª
There are many Github profiles in this world, but this one is my very own.

![Top Langs](https://githubstats.aj-v.de/api/top-langs/?username=aljoshavieth&layout=compact&langs_count=8&exclude_repo=github-readme-stats)

I completed a Master's degree in Computer Science at Furtwangen University.
For a better overview, I have outsourced some projects that were created during my studies to an organisation. You can find it [here](https://github.com/aljosha-hfu).
